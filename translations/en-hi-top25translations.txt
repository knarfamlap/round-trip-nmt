Test Sentence: Sadness is an inevitable part of the bereavement process.
Top 25 Translations
	Pains and suffering play a powerful part in the hope of a resurrection.
	Suffering is a very fundamental part of the resurrection hope. It is a source of joy and satisfaction to know that all those who love and serve God have faith in the resurrection hope.
	Sad to say, pain and pain is a very important part of the resurrection hope.
	Suffering and pain are an absolute part of the resurrection hope. The Bible states: "Those who are in accord with [God's] will will will become rich through the sword, and they will be called to account for their error. "
	Sadness is a strong part of the resurrection hope.
	The Bible says: "Happy is anyone fearing Jehovah, whose name is he who reads in Zion; and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah his God, the Almighty, the Maker of heaven and earth. "
	Another part of the suffering is pain, not part of the process in life.
	Another part of suffering is this process of life itself, no further part of it. In addition, the Bible shows that Jesus said: "He that receives me receives him also that sent me forth. "

	Sadly, there are few details regarding the events that are to take place after death.
	Sadly, there is no lack of suffering in life before death. In addition, life has been a most difficult time in human history.
	As a result, the death of the loved one is not meant to end suffering; nor will it cause suffering.
	Unfortunately, there is no lack of sorrow in our lives before death.
	Sadly, death is a death sentence. There is no end to the pain and suffering that plague mankind in this old age.
	The Bible states: "No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other; because he has become wise in his dealings with the other, but will possess the earth. "
	The Bible also teaches us that death is "a fiery furnace. " Sadly, death is the most lethal cause for our loved ones.
	Sadly, the death of our loved ones has been a very dangerous experience.
	The death toll of loved ones is a very tragic one. But death and death will never come to an end.
	As we have seen, a death toll has proved to be an extremely serious test for our loved ones.
